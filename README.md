# Local Protein Cost Project
 This is a PowerBI project that visualizes the cost of 20g of protein from 30+ food sources found at 4 major grocery stores in the Metro-Atlanta area; analyzing the differences in costs between stores, food groups, and dietary restrictions.

## Project Requirements 
Being in the medical field is an unnecessary requisite to express the importance of protein in a healthy diet. Being a financial guru is an unnecessary requisite to express to you the importance of being mindful of your wallet. Across the U.S., there are [63,328 supermarkets](https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/grocery-store-statistics-where-when-how-much-people-grocery-shop/)  and grocery store businesses; however to fit the various needs of a consumer in Metro-Atlanta 4 stores define them best. 
Publix, a south-eastern employee-owned American supermarket chain 
Trader Joe’s, a store full of unique and interesting products, along with everyday basics, in the chain’s label
H-Mart, an American grocery chain that offers a full line of Asian foods as well as a broad range of Western groceries to complement its fullscale offering to that of a traditional supermarket
Buford Highway Farmer’s Market, a large market with a global & ethnic focus in the selection of local produce, meats & seafood

While we make no medical claims, we believe the customer is to take charge of their well-being. Moreover, in a manner that deviates from the standard protocol of health that we observe in the United States. Rather than following the generic approach to diet by proxy of the food pyramid, people should take extra care to understand what is essential for everyone to sustain their body, and what is unique to their bodies and lifestyles. For the [United States](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fadvances%2Fnmz023), a modernized, more comprehensive metric for protein quality is needed—one that takes into account not only the quality of a food's amino acid profile but also the quality of its impact on human health and the environment. It should be noted that our investigation does NOT consider physical activity directly, though it is integral to well-being alongside nutrition. 

### Goal of Bar graph
* Represents a range of prices visually
* Represents deviation as well (is the range skewed toward one price range or spread evenly?)
#### Goal of Slicer/Filter
Allows us to show differences in each food group and diet type

* Average Cost Across All Stores
* Average Costs Per Store
* Average Cost Per Food Group
* Average Cost Per Diet Type
* Investigation of Costs for different Weight Classes
  * Example: 180 lb male vs 120 lb female, 205 lb male vs 150 lb male, etc
* Future Considerations/Overlooked Parameters
